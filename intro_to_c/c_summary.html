      <h1>C Summary</h1>
    </header>

    <h2>Types</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <code>
      short, int, long, NSInteger
    </code>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Represent integers. <code>short</code> holds smaller numbers
    than <code>int</code>, which is smaller
    than <code>long</code>. <code>NSInteger</code> is a type provided
    by Apple that is an integer of the ideal size for the current
    platform, be it iOS or OS X.
  </dd>
  <dt><code>float, double, CGFloat</code></dt>
  <dd>
    Decimal numbers, <code>double</code> is capable of storing higher
    precision numbers than <code>float</code>, but uses up double the
    storage space. CGFloat is the decimal type used by the iOS Core
    Graphics framework.
  </dd>
  <dt>Pointer</dt>
  <dd>
    Pointers are variables that "point" to other variables. In
    Objective-C, we never deal with objects directly, but instead pass
    around pointers to them. This is why when we declare an object,
    the variable that we store is a pointer to the object.<br>
    <code>NSDate *today = [NSDate date];</code><br>
    Technically we say that "today is a pointer to an NSDate,"
    however since objects are always stored as pointers, normally
    you will just say that "today is an NSDate."
  </dd>
  <dt><code>struct</code></dt>
  <dd>
    Structures are composite types. They allow us to group together
    data into a more complicated concept. For example I want a type
    Location that knows the name, latitude, and longitude of a
    location and the number of times I had visited that place.
    <pre>
typedef struct {
  float latitude;
  float longitude;
  int visits;
} Location;
    </pre>

Elements of a struct are accessed using dot notation.

<pre>
Location theFactory;
theFactory.latitude = 42.963107; 
theFactory.longitude = -85.669407;
theFactory.visits = 42;
</pre>

Structs are used frequently in iOS development. Try looking up NSRect
in the XCode documentation.  NSRects are used to represent the
location of a user interface element
      </dd>

  <dt><code>BOOL</code></dt>
  <dd>
    Boolean values, takes two values, <code>YES</code>
    or <code>NO</code>.
  </dd>
</dl>


<h2>Format Strings</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>Integers</dt>
  <dd>%i</dd>
  <dt>Decimals (floats)</dt>
  <dd>%f</dd>
  <dt>NSString</dt>
  <dd>%@</dd>
</dl>

<pre>
NSString *name = @"The Tempest";
float height = 1.75;
int age = 42;
NSLog(@"%@ is my favorite Shakepear play", name);
NSLog(@"You must be at least %f meteres tall to ride this ride", height);
NSLog(@"That person over there is %i years old", age);
</pre>

<h2>Functions</h2>

<pre>
rtype functionName(type1 arg1, type2 arg2)
</pre>

<h2>Including Libraries</h2>
<pre>
#import &lt;math.h&gt;  // Angle brackets for accessing built-in functions
#import "MyAwesomeUtility.h" // Quotes for accessing user functions
</pre>

<h2>Conditionals </h2>
<pre>
if (condition) {
  // Do if condition is true
} else {
  // Do if condition is false
}
</pre>

<h2>Loops</h2>

<h3>While</h3>
<pre>
while (condition) {
  // Run this as long as condition is true
}
</pre>

<h3>For</h3>
<pre>
for (initialize; test; increment) {
// Run this as long as test passes, preform increment 
// at the end of every loop
}
</pre>

  <h1>Excersizes</h1>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Write a program that will convert temperatures from Celsius to
      Farenheit and back. The program will do this until the user
      decides to quit.
    </li>
    <li>
      Write a text-based adventure game. The player starts at a random
      location and must find the treasure. Represent the player, treasure,
      and map extent with structs. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Search for a C library that performs a task you are interested in.
      Write a small program that uses a function from that library.
    </li>
