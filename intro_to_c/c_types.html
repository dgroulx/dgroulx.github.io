      <h1>C Types</h1>
    </header>

    <h2>What does Static Typing Mean?</h2>
<p>
  C is a statically typed language. This means that variables must
  be declared with a type and cannot change through the lifetime
  of the program. In a dynamicly typed language such as Ruby or
  Javascript, variables can hold data of any type over their
  lifetime. For example, in Javascript:
</p>

<pre>
> var dyanmicVar;
undefined
> dynamicVar = "a string";
'a string'
> typeof dynamicVar;
'string'
> dynamicVar = 2;
2
> typeof dynamicVar;
'number'
</pre>

<p>Now lets try the same thing in C</p>

<pre>
NSString *staticVar = @"a string";
staticVar = 2;
</pre>

<p>
  This should generate a compilre error <code>Implicit conversion of
    'int' to 'NSString *' is disallowed with ARC</code>. The first
    major difference here is that there is a program called the
    compiler that is attempting to enforce type correctness. While
    this can be irritating at first, static typing can also help catch
    errors in your programs. For example, in the Javascript program
    above, what if some part of the program was expecing
  <code>dynamicVar</code> to be a string. You wouldn't know there was an issue until
  actually executing the program. And then, you would have to back up 
  to the location where <code>dynamicVar</code> was assigned a non-string. 
</p>

<p>
  Dynamic vs. static typing is one of those issues in programming
  language design that people feel strongly about. Ultimatley we don't
  have a choice since Objective-C was chosen for us, so lets learn to
  take advantage of the warnings and errors given by the compiler.
</p>

<h2>C Built-In Types</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <code>
      short, int, long, NSInteger
    </code>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Represent integers. <code>short</code> holds smaller numbers
    than <code>int</code>, which is smaller
    than <code>long</code>. <code>NSInteger</code> is a type provided
    by Apple that is an integer of the ideal size for the current
    platform, be it iOS or OS X.
  </dd>
  <dt><code>float, double, CGFloat</code></dt>
  <dd>
    Decimal numbers, <code>double</code> is capable of storing higher
    precision numbers than <code>float</code>, but uses up double the
    storage space. CGFloat is the decimal type used by the iOS Core
    Graphics framework.
  </dd>
  <dt>Pointer</dt>
  <dd>
    Pointers are variables that "point" to other variables. In
    Objective-C, we never deal with objects directly, but instead pass
    around pointers to them. This is why when we declare an object,
    the variable that we store is a pointer to the object.<br>
    <code>NSDate *today = [NSDate date];</code><br>
    Technically we say that "today is a pointer to an NSDate,"
    however since objects are always stored as pointers, normally
    you will just say that "today is an NSDate."
  </dd>
  <dt><code>struct</code></dt>
  <dd>
    Structures are composite types. They allow us to group together
    data into a more complicated concept. For example I want a type
    Location that knows the name, latitude, and longitude of a
    location and the number of times I had visited that place.
    <pre>
typedef struct {
  float latitude;
  float longitude;
  int visits;
} Location;
    </pre>

Elements of a struct are accessed using dot notation.

<pre>
Location theFactory;
theFactory.latitude = 42.963107; 
theFactory.longitude = -85.669407;
theFactory.visits = 42;
</pre>

Structs are used frequently in iOS development. Try looking up NSRect
in the XCode documentation.  NSRects are used to represent the
location of a user interface element
      </dd>

  <dt><code>BOOL</code></dt>
  <dd>
    Boolean values, takes two values, <code>YES</code>
    or <code>NO</code>.
  </dd>
</dl>


<p>
  That's all there is. With nothing but numbers, words, and
  collections of the two, we can describe most any concept you
  want.
</p>

<h2>Declaring Variables</h2>

<p>
  Before we can use a variable to store data, it must be delcared with both
  a name and a type. 
</p>
<pre>
int anInteger;
float aDecimal;
NSString *aString; // "string" is programmer talk for text.
</pre>
<p>
  Unlike int and float which are built-in C
  types, <code>NSString</code> is actually a class specific to
  Objective-C. The variable <code>aString</code> will hold a pointer
  to an instance of <code>NSString</code>. If you are unfamiliar with
  words like class, object, and instance, don't worry too much now, we
  will cover them in detail in the next section. For now, just know
  that if you need a variable to hold some text, you delcare it of
  type <code>NSString *</code>.
</p>

<h2>Assigning Variables</h2>

<p>Now that we have some variables, we should store data in them. A single
equal sign <code>=</code> is used to store the value on the right side
into the variable on the left side.

<pre>
int anInteger;
float aDecimal;
NSString *aString; // "string" is programmer talk for text.
anInteger = 5;
aDecimal = 2.7182;
aString = @“The Deliverator belongs to an elite order, a hallowed subcategory.”;
</pre>

<p>
  This example both declares several variables, and then assigns values to them.
</p>

<h2>Combining Declaration and Assignment</h2>

<p>
  It is possible to combine both the declaration and assignment of a variable
  into the same line.
</p>

<pre>
int anInteger = 5;
float aDecimal = 2.7182;
NSString *aString = @“The Deliverator belongs to an elite order, a hallowed subcategory.”;
</pre>

  <h1>Exercises</h1>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Declare and assign a variable of types int, float, and
      NSString*. Confirm that your program will run. While we can't
      see any output yet, if it runs you are probably doing it right.
    </li>
    <li>
      Create variables of different types and try assigning them to
      one another. What kind of compiler messages do you get?
    </li>
  </ol>
